Uninstalling/Re-installing Aptana
======================================================================================

If you need to fully uninstall and reinstall RadRails, you must delete a few folders
that are not automatically deleted by the uninstaller. Please see the instructions
entitled 'How do I repair my Aptana Studio installation?' at:

(The instructions are specific to Aptana Studio, but work equally well for RadRails)
