WARRANTY.\n\
\n\
For Evaluation License.

THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT HAS NOT RELIED ON ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE, WHETHER GIVEN BY APTANA, ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES.\n\
\n\
For Full License. If Licensee has a Full License, the following terms shall apply:\n\
\n\
LIMITED WARRANTY. For a period of thirty (30) days after the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the date Licensee pays the License Fee (the "Warranty Period"), Aptana warrants that the Software, when used as permitted under this Agreement and in accordance with the Documentation (including use on a computer hardware and operating system platform supported by Aptana), will operate substantially as described in the Documentation. Aptana does not warrant that the Licensee's use of the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted. Aptana will, at its own expense and as its sole obligation and Licensee's exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, in its sole discretion either (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any reproducible error in the Software reported to Aptana by Licensee in writing during the Warranty Period or (b) refund to Licensee all License Fees actually paid, in which case this Agreement and Licensee's right to use the Software will be terminated. Any such error correction provided to Licensee will not extend the original Warranty Period. Any modifications of the Software by any person other than Aptana or its authorized agents or subcontractors and any use of the Software not in accordance with the Documentation or this Agreement will void the foregoing warranty.\n\
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 9.2(a) ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES STATED IN SECTION 9.2(a), THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT HAS NOT RELIED ON ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE, WHETHER GIVEN BY APTANA, ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES.\n\
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APTANA OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO BUSINESS INFORMATION OR DATA OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF APTANA OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL APTANA'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE) EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE LICENSE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO APTANA OR FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00). APTANA'S LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND APTANA WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.\n\
Miscellaneous.\n\
\n\
This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of any other state. Both parties agree that any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement must be brought in a court in Santa Clara County, California, and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding. The United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.\n\
\n\
If Licensee is a branch or agency of the United States Government, the following provision applies. The Software and Documentation are comprised of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and are provided to the Government (i) for acquisition by or on behalf of civilian agencies, consistent with the policy set forth in 48 C.F.R. 12.212; or (ii) for acquisition by or on behalf of units of the Department of Defense, consistent with the policies set forth in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3.\n\
\n\
The parties are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, franchise, joint venture, or employment relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.\n\
\n\
Licensee may not assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any third party without Aptana's prior written consent, and any purported attempt to do so is null and void. Aptana may freely assign or transfer its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any third party.\n\
\n\
The Software and Documentation may be subject to export controls under U.S. or other export laws and regulations. Licensee agrees that Licensee shall not export or re-export the Software in any form in violation of the export or import laws and regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction.\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and to such end the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. In such event, the affected provision shall be amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee agrees that Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) will remain in effect notwithstanding the unenforceability of any provision in Section 9 (Warranty).\n\
\n\
Any notices required by this Agreement shall be provided to Aptana at Aptana, Inc., 1450 Fashion Island Blvd., Suite 500, San Mateo, CA 94404 and to Licensee at the email or physical address provided by Licensee upon download of the Software.\n\
\n\
Aptana's rights and remedies for breach of this Agreement are cumulative. Licensee acknowledges that the Software contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Aptana, that any actual or threatened breach of Section 4 will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to Aptana for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach.\n\
\n\
This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed authorized representatives on behalf of both parties. All waivers under this Agreement must be in writing, and any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or on any other occasion. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all other prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings both written and oral between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Without limiting the foregoing, this Agreement supersedes any license terms contained within the source code of the Software.
